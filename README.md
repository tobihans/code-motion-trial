# Experimental Code Editing Animation

This is an attempt to create an animation for code editing, using [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/).

## Setup

To setup, you obviously need Node.js. Then install and launch the project:

```shell
npm install
npm serve
```

Head over to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the animation.
